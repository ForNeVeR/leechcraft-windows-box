Installing
----------

### System requirements

There are no specific requirements to the host system. It should just
be capable of running the VirtualBox, the Vagrant and the
vagrant-windows plugin. You will probably need many system resources
for building the whole Leechcraft.

### Prerequisites

1. Install the [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) for your
   operating system.
2. Install the [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/).
3. Install the
   [vagrant-windows plugin](https://github.com/WinRb/vagrant-windows)
   according to the instructions on their site.
4. Download the Windows 8.1 ISO image. [Windows 8.1 Evaluation 
   version](http://technet.microsoft.com/ru-ru/windows/hh771457.aspx)
   may or may not be okay for you - check the license yourself.
